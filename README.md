# Unity 

A user friendly mobile app which can work both online and offline mode that let users know about the upcoming natural disaster that is going to occur in the area where they are & helps them to recover from that disaster effectively as to save themselves & their loved ones. 

This app also educates the people about the main types of disasters, and helps in spreading awareness about the safety protocols that have to be followed when disaster strikes. The application should guide the user about what to do, where to find help, try to crowdsource this help and also send out targeted alerts using location-based technologies.
